<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Industrial Cooling Tower Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cooling Tower</li><li>Closed Cooling Tower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dry industrial cooling tower market consists of two primary types: open cooling towers and closed cooling towers. Open cooling towers function by directly exposing water to the air, allowing for evaporative cooling, which is efficient but may be susceptible to contamination. In contrast, closed cooling towers separate the process fluid from the environment, utilizing a heat exchanger for more controlled cooling and reduced risk of contamination. Both types serve essential roles in various industrial applications, ensuring effective heat management.</p></p>
