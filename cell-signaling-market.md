<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cell Signaling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endocrine</li><li>Paracrine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cell signaling markets can be categorized primarily into two types: endocrine and paracrine signaling. Endocrine signaling involves hormones released into the bloodstream by glands, affecting distant target organs and regulating systemic functions like metabolism and growth. In contrast, paracrine signaling occurs when cells produce signaling molecules that influence nearby cells, facilitating localized communication and responses, such as inflammation or tissue repair. Both market types play crucial roles in therapeutic development and the understanding of various biological processes.</p></p>
