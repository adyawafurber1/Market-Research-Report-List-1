<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Drilling Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Circulation</li><li>Reverse Circulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary drilling machines operate primarily in two market types: normal circulation and reverse circulation. Normal circulation involves the drilling fluid, or mud, flowing down the drill pipe, carrying cuttings up to the surface. This method is commonly used for shallow wells. Reverse circulation, on the other hand, pumps fluid down the annulus while bringing cuttings up through the drill pipe, ensuring better sample accuracy and reducing contamination. Each type is suited for specific geological conditions and drilling requirements.</p></p>
