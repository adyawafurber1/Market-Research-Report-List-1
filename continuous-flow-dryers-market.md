<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuous Flow Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tower</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Continuous Flow Dryers market is primarily divided into two types: tower dryers and horizontal dryers. Tower dryers are vertical systems that facilitate efficient grain drying by allowing material to flow continuously through a tall structure, maximizing heat exposure and minimizing space requirements. In contrast, horizontal dryers feature a more traditional design, with a cylindrical shape that allows material to be dried as it moves horizontally. Each type serves different applications and operational needs, catering to various industrial drying processes.</p></p>
